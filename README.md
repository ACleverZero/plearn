Plunder Knowledge

  This project uses the history of responses you and other plearners provide to learn
  which exercise will optimally enhance your understanding.
  
  Inputs include your preferences, (e.g. the topic you seek to mistress, how focused you feel, etc...),
  the history of your responses to previous exercises, and the values of those inputs associated with
  other plearners.
